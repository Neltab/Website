## Who am I?

Hi. I'm Aurélien. A junior engineer in computer science. I just finished my end-of-study internship at [LS2N](https://www.ls2n.fr/en/), a research laboratory in Nantes, France. I'm currently looking for a job in web development but I am eager to fill in a position in the field of machine learning.

I like learning new things on differents topics like astronomy, biology or the recent discoveries in large language model AI like Chat GPT. I also have a passion for small, indie video games as they explore more deeply some intricacies of the medium than most games from bigger studios. As a real life counter part, I like to play and write table top role playing games. They are a fun way to learn writing, staging, improvisation and game design skills while having a great time with friends. 

## My Experience

During my 5 years at Polytech Nantes, I tried to explore as much as possible the domains that appealed the most to me. I did two internship as a fullstack web developper and one as a machine learning engineer. I also did a lot of [projects](https://aurelienboissiere.fr/projects/) in my free time. Most of them are small games developped during an event called [Game Jam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_jam). Finally, I did a lot of projects during my studies. The most recent ones were made during my abroad semester at [Laval University](https://www.ulaval.ca/en/) in Quebec, Canada. I had the opportunity to take multiple courses in machine learning and computer vision.
